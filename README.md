# cards_2to3
Repository to store cards and scripts to simulate MG events

By now the NLO and LO subfolders contain the cards for finite width, 
but only for the BW approximation for decay.


2>3 => channel (LO and NLO) (model and run cards to 4FS) 

2>2 => channel (LO and NLO) (model run cards to 5FS)
